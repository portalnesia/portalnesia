The Client Credentials flow is used in server-to-server authentication. Since this flow does not include authorization, only endpoints that do not access user information can be accessed.

# Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have created an app following the [app settings docs](/developer/docs/app-settings).

# Request Authorization

The first step is to send a POST request to the `https://accounts.portalnesia.com/oauth/authorization` endpoint of the Spotify OAuth 2.0 Service with the following parameters encoded in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`:

| REQUEST BODY PARAMETER | VALUE |
| --- | --- |
| grant_type | *Required*<br />This field must contain the value `authorization_code`.  |
| redirect_uri | *Required*<br />This parameter is used for validation only (there is no actual redirection). The value of this parameter must exactly match the value of `redirect_uri` supplied when requesting the authorization code. |

The request must include the following HTTP headers:

| HEADER PARAMETER | VALUE |
| --- | --- |
| PN-Client-Id | *Required*<br />The client ID for your app, available from the developer dashboard. |
| Authorization | *Required if not implementing PKCE*<br />Base 64 encoded string that contains the client ID and client secret key. The field must have the format: `Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded client_id:client_secret>` |
| Content-Type | *Required*<br />Set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. |

If everything goes well, youâ€™ll receive a response similar to this containing the Access Token:

```json
{
  "id_token": "eyJhCJ9...Ok6yJV_adw5c",
  "access_token": "NgCXRKc...MzYjw",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
}
```
